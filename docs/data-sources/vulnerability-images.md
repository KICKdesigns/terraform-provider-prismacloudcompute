# prismacloudcompute_policiesvulnerabilityimages

Manage cloud compute vulnerability image policies.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "prismacloudcompute_policiesvulnerabilityimages" "example" {
    name = "My Policy"
    policy_type = "network"
    rule {
        name = "my rule"
        criteria = "savedSearchId"
        parameters = {
            "savedSearch": "true",
            "withIac": "false",
        }
        rule_type = "Network"
    }
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `filters` - Filter policy results.
* `_id` - ID of the policy set.
* `policytype` - Type of policy. For example: `docker`, `containerVulnerability`, `containerCompliance`, etc.
* [`rules`](#rules) - List of policy rules.

### Rules

* `action` - Action to take.
* [`alertthreshold`](#alert-threshold) - The vulnerability policy alert threshold. Threshold values typically vary between 0 and 10 (non-inclusive).
* `allcompliance` - If set to `true`, reports the results of all (passed and failed) compliance checks.
* `auditallowed` - If set to `true`, Prisma Cloud audits successful transactions.
* `blockmsg` - Represents the block message in a policy.
* [`blockthreshold`](#block-threshold) - The vulnerability policy block threshold. Threshold values typically vary between 0 and 10 (non-inclusive).
* [`collections`](#collections) - List of collections. Used to scope the rule.
* [`condition`](#condition) - Rule conditions. Conditions only apply for their respective policy type.
* [`cverules`](#cve-rules) - List of Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) IDs classified for special handling/exceptions.
* `disabled` - If set to `true`, the rule is currently disabled.
* `effect` - The effect of evaluating the given policy. Can be set to `allow`, `deny`, `block`, or `alert`.
* `gracedays` - Number of days to suppress the rule's block effect. Measured from date the vuln was fixed. If there's no fix, measured from the date the vuln was published.
* `group` - Applicable groups.
* [`license`](#license) - The configuration of the compliance policy license.
* `modified` - Date/time when the rule was last modified.
* `name` - Name of the rule.
* `notes` - Free-form text notes.
* `onlyfixed` - If set to `true`, applies rule only when vendor fixes are available.
* `owner` - User who created or last modified the rule.
* `previousname` - Previous name of the rule. Required for rule renaming.
* `principal` - Applicable users.
* [`tags`](#tags) - List of tags classified for special handling/exceptions.
* `verbose` - If set to `true`, displays a detailed message when an operation is blocked.

#### Alert Threshold

* `enabled` - If set to `true`, enables alerts.
* `disabled` - If set to `true`, suppresses alerts for all vulnerabilities.
* `value` - Minimum severity to trigger alerts. Supported values range from 0 to 9, where 0=off, 1=low, and 9=critical.

#### Block Threshold

* `enabled` - If set to `true`, enables blocking.
* `disabled` - If set to `true`, suppresses blocking for all vulnerabilities.
* `value` - Minimum severity to trigger blocking. Supported values range from 0 to 9, where 0=off, 1=low, and 9=critical.

#### Collections

* `accountids` - List of account IDs.
* `appids` - List of application IDs.
* `clusters` - List of Kubernetes cluster names.
* `coderepos` - List of code repositories.
* `color` - Hex color code for a collection.
* `containers` - List of containers.
* `description` - A free-form text description of the collection.
* `functions` - List of functions.
* `hosts` - List of hosts.
* `images` - List of images.
* `labels` - List of labels.
* `modified` - Date/time when the collection was last modified.
* `name` - Unique collection name.
* `namespaces` - List of Kubernetes namespaces.
* `owner` - User who created or last modified the collection.
* `prisma` - If set to `true`, this collection originates from Prisma Cloud.
* `system` - If set to `true`, this collection was created by the system (i.e., a non-user). Otherwise it was created by a real user.

#### Condition

* `device` - Allowed volume host device (wildcard). If a `container create` command specifies a non-matching host device, the action is blocked. Only applies to rules in certain policy types.
* `readonly` - If set to `true`, the condition applies only to read-only commands. For example: HTTP GET requests.
* [`vulnerabilities`](#vulnerabilities) - Block and scan severity-based vulnerabilities conditions.

##### Vulnerabilities

* `block` - If set to `true`, the effect is blocked.
* `id` - Vulnerability ID.

#### CVE Rules

* `description` - Free-form text for documenting the exception.
* `effect` - Specifies the relevant action for a vulnerability. Can be set to `ignore`, `alert`, or `block`.
* `id` - CVE ID
* [`expiration`](#expiration) - The vulnerability expiration date.

##### Expiration

* `date` - The date the vulnerability expires.
* `enabled` - If set to `true`, the grace period is enabled.

#### License

* [`alertThreshold`](#alert-Threshold) - The license severity threshold to indicate whether to perform an alert action. Threshold values typically vary between 0 and 10 (non-inclusive).
* [`blockThreshold`](#block-Threshold) - The license severity threshold to indicate whether to perform a block action. Threshold values typically vary between 0 and 10 (non-inclusive).
* `critical` - The list of licenses with critical severity.
* `high` - The list of licenses with high severity.
* `low` - The list of licenses with low severity.
* `medium` - The list of licenses with medium severity.

##### Alert Threshold

* `enabled` - If set to `true`, the alert action is enabled.
* `disabled` - Disabled.
* `value` - The minimum severity score for which the alert action is enabled.

##### Block Threshold

* `enabled` - If set to `true`, the block action is enabled.
* `disabled` - Disabled.
* `value` - The minimum severity score for which the block action is enabled.

#### Tags

* `description` - Free-form text for documenting the exception.
* `effect` - Specifies the relevant action for a vulnerability. Can be set to `ignore`, `alert`, or `block`.
* [`expiration`](#expiration) - The vulnerability expiration date.
* `name` - Tag name.

##### Expiration

* `date` - Date of the vulnerability expiration.
* `enabled` - If set to `true`, the grace period is enabled.
